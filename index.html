    <h2>hello everyone</h2>
    <p> did you know that bees are great? people are afraid of bees because they can sting. however, bees dont sting without being threatened first. 
      so if you ever get stung, it was probably your fault.
    </p>

    <h3>bees are silly, just like you and me</h3>
    <p>one time i read a study about how bees can play. they were monitored in a lab and layed with a ball. it wasnt for anything productive, it was just for fun :) they like enrichment
